## A brief intro to teeth whitening here in Harrisonburg, VA
______________________________________________________________ 

Teeth whitening is a wonderful way of obtaining a killer smile and kick butt confidence. You will indeed enjoy the non invasive 
technique of some of the towns local offices. In general you can find teeth whitening gel that is also vegan and sensitivity free. 
In general though you will have to avoid some of your favorite drinks or coffees but in the end itll all be worth the discipline.
In general you will also have to refrain from cheating on your instructions. You wouldnt want to spend hundreds to thousands of dollars 
just to see it go down the drain because you didnt wait 24 to 72 hours to snap back to old eating habits that werent restricted. I will list
some of those mentioned above that you should **AVOID**! 

### Keep away from these five things Items you will want to avoid: 

_____________________________

<ol>
<li> Avoid foods with added colorants: beef, soy sauce, ketchup, bologna, and chocolate are examples.</li> 
<li> Avoid funky beverages: for instance, tea, coffee, red wine, cola, and tomato juice.</li> 
<li> Avoid acidic liquids: examples are soft drinks, fruit juices, and alcohol in general.</li> 
<li> Avoid sugary food: cakes, cookies, ice cream, etc., can trigger decay-causing bacteria, causing tooth irritation and possible staining.(**YES THIS INCLUDES CHOCOLATE...SORRY**)</li> 
<li> Lastly avoid ANY ITEM THAT WILL FAIL THE "White shirt test": avoid any food that would leave a visible stain on a white piece of clothing for the first 24 hours after whitening.</li> 
</ol>

You could start:

<ol>
<li> Brushing your teeth twice a day or after every meal so that there is no room for tartar to sit on the teeth and solidify.</li> 

<li> Try stimulating a lot of saliva, this is a natural cleaner for your mouth!</li> 

<li> Eat your fruits and veggies. I mean weve all heard it since we were children but youll be surprised how many people dont eat their veggies and fruits. I know yall have heard,
As every Grandma said:

> An apple a day
> will keep the doctors away.</li> 

<li> You could also invest in an eletric toothbrush, it doesnt have to be hundred of dollars. I have one from walmart that was only around eight dollars
and it works wonders and really gets the job done alright. I can add the link below: </li>
